## Project Details

### Overview
_Our project focuses on leveraging AI and data-driven insights to promote sustainable energy consumption. By analyzing real-time energy usage, weather patterns, and smart device data, we provide actionable recommendations to optimize efficiency and reduce costs. Our solution empowers users to make informed decisions, contributing to a greener future_

### Problem Statement
_Traditional energy consumption patterns fail to optimize costs with Time-of-Use (ToU) tariffs,
 leading to higher bills and inefficient solar energy use. The lack of real-time monitoring and
 smart scheduling limits energy efficiency. Our Platform aims to solve this by providing real-time
 tariff tracking, AI-driven forecasting, and automated energy management, maximizing savings
 and promoting renewable energy usage._

### Solution
_Develop a smart AI-powered platform that optimizes energy consumption based on Time-of-Use (ToU) tariffs, helping users reduce costs and improve efficiency. The platform leverages real-time data, analytics, and automation to provide intelligent energy management._
